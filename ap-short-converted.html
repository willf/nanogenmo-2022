    <h1>Against Praxeas</h1>
    <p>
      <b> 1 </b>
      The devil has shown hostility to the Truth in many ways.He has tried to
      defend it at times, but he's only pretending.He is the champion of the one
      Lord, the Almighty, the creator of the world, so that he may make a heresy
      out of the unity.He says that the Father himself came down into the
      virgin, himself was born of her, himself suffered, in short himself is
      Jesus Christ.- The serpent has forgotten himself: for when he tempted
      Jesus Christ after the baptism of John it was as Son of God that he
      attacked him, being assured that God has a son at least from those very
      scriptures which speak of the serpent as the tempter.He was creating the
      temptation from different aspects.
      <i>
        If you are the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
      </i>
      : again,
      <i>
        shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee, and in their hands
        they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a
        stone. If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here. It is
        written that he will give his angels charge over you, to keep you, and
        they will bear you up in their hands, so that you will not dash your
        foot against a stone.
      </i>
      The father, of course.
      <i>
        God has given his angels orders to take care of you and keep you from
        stumbling.
      </i>
      Or will he accuse the gospels of lying, and say, "Let Matthew and Luke see
      to it: I for my part approached God himself, I tempted the Almighty hand
      to hand: that was the reason for my approach, that wager was my stake, and
      I won it."as the reason for the temptation: otherwise, if it had been only
      God's son, perhaps I should not have demeaned myself to tempt him"?No, he
      himself is a liar from the beginning, and anyone he has paid to lie for
      him, like Praxeas.his having been the first to confess. This person was
      the first to import to Rome out of Asia a wrongheadedness-a man generally
      of restless character, and moreover puffed up with boasting of his
      confessorship on account of his having been the first to confess.Although
      he would have profited nothing if he had given his body to be burned, he
      would have only experienced a short discomfort of imprisonment.also drove
      out by force.At that time, the bishop of Rome was about to recognize the
      prophecies of Montanus and Prisca and Maximilla, and as a result, was
      offering peace to the churches of Asia.tered men and to excommunicate the
      rest This man made false claims about the prophets and their churches, and
      insisted on the decisions of the bishop's predecessors. Because of this,
      the bishop was forced to recall the lettered men and excommunicate the
      rest.The terms of peace have already been issued, so please stop trying to
      receive spiritual gifts.Praxeas did two things that pleased the devil: he
      got rid of prophecy and introduced false teaching. He chased away the Holy
      Spirit and put Jesus to death.Weeds were planted among the wheat, and they
      have also sprouted here, while many people are asleep in their
      naivete.After that, they were revealed by whoever God wanted, and it
      seemed like they had been completely removed.The teacher gave up his old
      opinions and promised to obey the new rules. His promise is kept by the
      people who were there when he made it.After that, no one said anything.I
      was separated from the natural men by my acknowledgement and defence of
      the Paraclete.But those weeds had at that time scattered their seed
      everywhere, and so for a time it lay hidden, deceptively pretending to be
      dead, and has now burst forth anew.But it will also be replanted if the
      Lord wills, in the time I have now: if not, then in its due time all
      counterfeit grain will be gathered and burned.He will be punished with
      unquenchable fire, along with other offenses.
