# On Patience

by Tertullian, 2nd Century
Modernized version of S. helwall's 1869 translation

## Patience in general and Tertullian’s unsuitability to discuss it

I freely admit to God that it was rash and probably even arrogant of me to write a treatise about patience when I am not a good person. It would be more fitting for someone who is recommending something to others to also practice it themselves, so their words are backed up by their actions. It would be great if feeling ashamed of not doing what we are encouraging others to do could motivate us to do it ourselves, but some things are too difficult and can only be accomplished with the help of divine grace. God is the only one who has true goodness and gives it out as is seen fit. So, it’s a bit like a sick person talking about health - since I don’t have patience, I’m always longing for it and asking God for it. I understand that faith and the Lord’s discipline don’t come easily without patience. Patience is essential for obeying God’s commands and doing works that please God. Even those who don’t have it recognize its value as the highest virtue. Philosophers, who are thought to be wise, highly value patience. Even though they disagree on many things, they agree that patience is important and pursue it together. They show off their wisdom by praising patience. Is this a good thing, since it makes a divine thing part of worldly knowledge? Those who do this will soon be ashamed and destroyed along with the world.

## God shows us patience

We do not find our patience from an emotionless model of canine equanimity; rather, it comes from God, who shows us patience by sending the same blessings to both the just and unjust, enduring ungrateful nations despite their worship of man-made idols and their persecution of God’s Name and family, and tolerating luxury, avarice, and iniquity. His patience is so great that many do not believe in God because they don’t realize He is angry with the world.

## Jesus Christ’s incarnation and work as an example

This kind of divine patience may seem too hard for us to understand, but God underwent being conceived in a mother’s womb and waited to be born. When he was born, he grew up slowly and didn’t demand recognition. He faced the temptations of the devil with words alone, and instead of being the Lord, he became a Master, teaching people how to avoid death by showing absolute patience even when offended. He did not fight or cry out; no one heard his voice in the streets. He did not break the bruised reed or put out the smoldering wick. This was because God’s own Spirit, along with patience, was in the Son and God had not spoken falsely. He welcomed everyone who wanted to follow him and did not reject anyone who offered him hospitality. He even washed the feet of his disciples, not just those of sinners or tax collectors. He was not angry with the city that had refused to receive him, even though His disciples wanted God to send fire down on it. He showed mercy to those who were ungrateful and gave in to His enemies. And he didn’t even point out his betrayer, even though he was with him. Moreover, while he was being betrayed, taken away like a sheep for a sacrifice, he didn’t approve of even one of his disciples using a sword to avenge him. His patience was wounded when Malchus was hurt. He cursed the use of the sword in the future and healed the person he hadn’t harmed in order to show mercy through patience. Even though crucifixion was the end he had come for, did he need to be treated with disrespect? No, but as he was about to leave this world, he wanted to show patience. He was pierced with a spear, whipped, mocked, put in filthy clothes and given a more shameful crown. How amazing is his faith in remaining calm! God had set before him the goal of concealing himself in human form, and he showed no sign of impatience! This is why, Pharisees, you should have recognized the Lord. No human being could have achieved such patience. The magnitude of this evidence—which causes some nations to reject the faith, but which serves as a reason and support for us—clearly demonstrates, not only through its teachings, but also through the Lord’s suffering, to those who are given faith that patience is a part of God’s nature.

## We should imitate our master

Therefore, if we see those who are honest and have good intentions behaving as they should, if obedience is the way to earn favor and submission is the rule of obedience, how much more should our conduct reflect our Lord’s? We are servants of the living God whose judgment will determine whether we will suffer punishment or be rewarded with salvation. To avoid punishment and gain salvation, we must be obedient. We even expect obedience from animals, knowing that they were provided for us by the Lord. Shouldn’t the creatures that God has subjected to us be obedient? They obey and acknowledge their masters, so why don’t we listen attentively to the Lord? It would be unfair and ungrateful not to repay the kindness that others have shown us. We don’t need to say more about being obedient to God because we understand what is expected of us. Patience is the key to obedience, and no impatient person will ever be obedient, nor will a patient person not find pleasure in it. Who can talk enough about the good that comes from being patient like God? We should all pursue good things with our whole heart because they are from God. This thought is a brief summary of how we should be patient.

## God is the source of patience, and the devil is the source of impatience.

Still, discussing the essentials of faith is not a waste of time; it can be beneficial. Talking can be useful if it leads to understanding. So, if the conversation is focused on something good, it’s important to also consider the opposite. You can better understand what to pursue if you first review what to avoid.

Let us think about impatience and whether, just like patience is from God, its opposite could have come from the devil. It would show that it’s opposed to faith. Whatever comes from God’s enemy is not friendly to God’s things. And since God is the best and the devil is the worst, they can’t work for each other. So good can’t come from the devil and evil can’t come from God. I think the devil was impatient when God made humans in God's image. If he wasn’t upset, he wouldn’t have been jealous of humans. He deceived humanity because he was jealous. He was jealous because he was upset. He was upset because he hadn’t been patient. It doesn’t matter which came first, malice or impatience, since they grew together in his heart. After learning how helpful impatience is for committing sin, he used it to push others into crime. When the woman met him, she was filled with impatience. She did not honor God’s command to be patient, and instead spoke to the devil in the presence of Adam, who was not yet her husband. As a result, another person perished due to her impatience, and Adam was also punished for not obeying God’s warning or recognizing the devil’s deception. Therefore, the first judgment against delinquency came from its origin. This is when God became angry with humanity for committing an offense. Instead of punishing humanity right away, God chose to curse them. What crime had humanity committed before this act of impatience? They were innocent and had a close relationship with God, tending the Garden of Eden. Once humanity lost their patience, they was no longer pleasing to God and could no longer handle heavenly things. From then on,they were creatures of the earth, separated from God’s sight, and easily swayed by impatience into doing things that displeased God. Quickly, this impatience gave birth to anger, which was then taught to use its own methods of destruction. Adam and Eve’s death was caused by impatience, and their son Cain also began with murder. It’s clear that he was impatient when the Lord rejected his offerings, and he became angry with his brother. So, it seems that impatience was what drove him to kill, and it was in its infancy at the time. But it grew quickly and it’s no surprise that it is the parent of all other crimes. We have talked about murder, which is often caused by anger. But impatience can also be a cause, whether it is a result of personal enmity or the desire for something. Whatever the motive is, it’s impossible to act without being impatient. Even adultery is driven by impatience of lust. When women sell their modesty for money, it is driven by impatience for gain. These are the main sins in the Lord’s eyes, because every sin can be attributed to impatience. Evil is an impatience of good. No one who is immoral is not impatient of modesty; dishonest of honesty; impious of piety; or unquiet of quietness. For someone to become evil, they must not be able to stay good. It’s obvious that this kind of bad behavior would offend God. Just look at Israel, who was impatient and forgot how God had freed them from Egypt. He asked Aaron for gods to guide him and gave gold to an idol. Israel also got impatient while Moses was meeting with God, and after the manna and water from the rock, they gave up on God because of a three-day thirst. In every case, the Israelites failed due to their impatience. How did they capture the prophets, other than because they were impatient to hear them? And the Lord himself, because they were impatient to see him? But if they had been patient, they would have been freed.

## Patience precedes and follows faith

Patience is both a result and a requirement of faith. In other words, Abraham believed God and was credited with righteousness, but it was his patience that proved his faith when he was asked to sacrifice his son. God knew who God had credited with righteousness, so Abraham patiently accepted this difficult command, even though it was not pleasing to the Lord. Therefore, Abraham deserved to be “blessed” because he was “faithful” and “patient.” So faith, combined with patience, spread among the nations through Abraham’s seed, Jesus Christ, and grace replaced the law. Patience helped to amplify and fulfill the law since it was lacking in the doctrine of righteousness. In the past, people used to believe that “an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth” was fair. They would get revenge by doing the same harm to someone else. But this was before patience was accepted on earth because faith was not yet known. Then, when Jesus came, He taught us that it is wrong to be angry with someone or to call them a fool. He said we should love our enemies, bless those who curse us, and pray for those who persecute us in order to be like our Heavenly Father. Can you see how patience can bring us closer to God? This main rule summarizes the universal practice of patience, since we don’t allow bad behavior even when it is deserved.

## Causes of impatience and their related advice

Now, while we look at the causes of impatience, all the other principles will also come into play. If we are angry because of property loss, the Lord’s Scriptures teach us to not care about worldly possessions. There is no better encouragement to ignore money than the fact that the Lord himself had no wealth. He always favored the poor and condemned the wealthy. So He showed us to accept loss with patience and scorn wealth as our lot in life. By not wanting riches, he taught us to not be too upset when something is taken away. The Spirit of the Lord has said through the apostle that “greed is the root of all evil.” We shouldn’t just think of greed as wanting what belongs to someone else. Everything we think is ours really belongs to God, so even if we get impatient when we lose something, it’s still a form of greed. When we let things of this world take priority over things of the spiritual world, we are going against God. We should be willing to give up worldly things and keep the heavenly ones. I would rather gain patience than anything else in this world. I don’t know if someone who isn’t willing to accept losses, either through theft, force, or carelessness, would be willing to give away their own possessions for charitable causes. Patience in losses is a way of giving and sharing. If you’re not afraid of losing something, it won’t be hard to give it away. How can we make friends through money if we don’t want to part with it? We’ll end up losing it all anyway. Why should we worry about it when it’s our job to let it go? It is the way of the world to be impatient in the face of loss, putting money before their souls. They will take risks for money, do anything for it, even hire themselves out for violence and crime. But we should be different, giving not our souls for money, but our money for our souls, either through giving or in accepting losses.

## Patience in the face of personal violence and insults

We who carry our souls and bodies in the world and show patience when we are hurt, should we be upset at the loss of less important things? As a follower of Christ, it would be wrong for us to abandon our patience when faced with minor issues. If someone tries to provoke us with physical violence, we should remember what the Lord said: “If anyone strikes you on the cheek, turn to them the other also.” We can overcome outrageousness by being patient. The Lord will punish those who hurt us more than we can. If the bitterness of words like curses or insults come out, remember what is said: “When they curse you, be happy.” The Lord himself was cursed according to the law, but he is still blessed. Let us servants follow our Lord closely and patiently bear being cursed, so that we can be blessed. If I hear something hateful said about me, I must either fight back or be filled with anger. When I respond to being cursed with my own words, how can I be following the Lord’s teaching that we are defiled by the words we speak, and that we will be held accountable for every idle word? Therefore, whatever the Lord keeps us from, He also instructs us to bear patiently from others.

Patience brings pleasure and power. When someone hurts you with their words or actions, patience can be like a rock — so solid that their attack will not hurt you. The one who hurt you gets no satisfaction because they cannot make you feel pain. You can walk away unscathed and even be pleased by your attacker’s disappointment and pain. This is the benefit and joy of patience.

## Patience in times of grief

We cannot excuse being impatient when we lose our loved ones, even if we feel like we have a right to grieve. The Apostle Paul said, “Don’t be too sad when someone dies, like those who have no hope.” Since we believe in the resurrection of the dead, it’s unnecessary to grieve and to be impatient with grief. Why grieve if you believe they are not truly gone? What you think of as death is just a departure. We should not lament them, but we can long for them with patience. Why should you be upset that someone has died when you will eventually die too? Hurrying things along in this situation doesn’t bode well for our hope, and it shows a lack of faith. We are disrespecting Christ when we don’t accept the death of someone He has called away from this world as if it were something to be pitied. The apostle said, “I desire to be now received and to be with Christ”. What a better wish than that! If we get too upset about those who have achieved the Christian desire, it shows that we are unwilling to achieve it ourselves.

## Revenge

There is also another major cause of impatience: the desire for revenge, either for glory or out of malice. But glory is always empty, and malice is always hated by the Lord. In this case, if someone is provoked by someone else’s malice and seeks revenge, they are in the wrong. Revenge may seem like a relief in the eyes of those who are wrong, but in the eyes of justice it is seen as malicious. What difference is there between the person who provokes and the one who is provoked, except that one started it and the other retaliated? Both are guilty of wronging someone in the eyes of the Lord, who forbids and condemns all wickedness. It doesn’t matter who started it; both are guilty. The rule is clear: evil should not be paid back with evil. Like for like. How can we follow this principle if we don’t reject revenge? And how can we honor God if we think we have the power to take revenge? We are weak, just like clay pots. When our own servants try to take revenge on each other, we are angry; but those who show patience, humility and loyalty, we reward more than they would have asked for. Is there any chance that God will behave differently when He judges and punishes? So why do we think He is a Judge and not an Avenger? God promises that He will take care of us and take vengeance on our behalf. He says, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay.” This means that we should be patient and trust in God. He also tells us not to judge, because if we judge others, we will be judged too. Who would want to judge another if they don’t want revenge? We should forgive instead of judging, and in doing so, we honor the one true Judge—God. If we act out of impatience, it often causes more harm than the situation itself. Nothing done with impatience can be done without recklessness, and usually ends with a stumble or a fall. If you take revenge too little, you’ll be angry; if you take too much, you’ll have to carry the burden. What do I have to do with revenge when I’m too impatient to measure it out? If I rely on patience, I won’t feel pain and won’t want to take revenge.

## More reasons to practice patience

We have identified the main causes of our impatience, so why should we look for more, both near and far? The Evil One can cause us a wide range of frustrations, some small and some large. We should ignore the small ones and accept the large ones because they are too powerful to resist. If we have done something wrong, we should take responsibility for it and accept it with patience. Let us use our equanimity to counter the enemy’s zeal. If we believe that some suffering is sent to us from God, who should we show more patience to than God? He even teaches us to give thanks and be happy when we are disciplined by God. He says, “Whom I love, I chasten.” We should be patient in all situations, whether it be our own fault or caused by evil. We will be rewarded with happiness. God calls the humble and patient people “blessed” and says, “Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.” No one can humble themselves without patience to endure the act of humbling. The Bible says, “Blessed are those who mourn.” Who can be tolerant of such sadness without patience? Consolation and joy are promised to those who are gentle. Can the impatient be considered “peacemakers” as God calls them his children? Even a fool can see that they cannot. When God says, “Rejoice and be glad when you are persecuted, for great is your reward in heaven,” it’s not meant for impatient people because no one can rejoice in adversity unless they have learned to be patient first.

## Love and patience

When it comes to the rule of peace, which is pleasing to God, who in this impatient world will forgive their brother or sister even once? Who will settle a dispute with their adversary without first getting rid of the anger, hardness, and bitterness caused by impatience? How can you “forgive and be forgiven” if you don’t have patience? No one can offer a “peaceful gift at the altar” if they don’t first return to patience. If we let our anger last until the sun goes down, we are in danger; we cannot go even one day without patience. Patience leads in all forms of discipline, so it’s no surprise that she helps Repentance, who often comes to the aid of those who have fallen. When divorce is allowed for a lawful reason, Patience waits, longs, and encourages repentance in those who hope to enter salvation. She helps the one from becoming an adulterer and the other from making the same mistake. We can also find examples of patience in the Lord’s parables. The shepherd patiently searches for and finds the lost ewe, instead of giving up on her. He then carries her home on his shoulders. The prodigal son tests his father’s patience, receiving clothes, food, and forgiveness in the face of his brother’s anger. He is saved from perishing because he repents. Repentance does not perish because it finds patience to accept it. What other teaching can lead to charity, the highest sacrament of faith, the source of the Christian name, which the apostle praises with the power of the Holy Spirit? He said, “Charity is long-suffering and applies patience. It is beneficent and does no harm. It is not jealous and does not use violence. It is humble and not violent. It does not seek its own benefit, but it can benefit others. It is not irritable either. Charity endures all things, tolerates all things, and will never fail because everything else will come to an end. Faith, hope, and charity are permanent because faith was brought in by Christ’s patience, hope waits for man’s patience, and charity is accompanied by patience with God as the leader.”

## Patience with physical pain

So far, I have been trying to understand patience and how it exists in the mind. I also try to show it in my actions, to please the Lord. Patience is a quality that the Lord himself has shown in his actions. So what is the role of patience in our actions? It is the affliction of the flesh, where we sacrifice our comfort and contentment to appease the Lord. We wear sordid clothing, eat simple diets, and drink only water. We also fast and sit in sackcloth and ashes. These actions add grace to our prayers for good and strength to our prayers against evil. They open the ears of Christ our God, soften his severity, and elicit his clemency. That Babylonian king, after he was exiled for seven years for offending the Lord, not only regained his kingdom but also made amends to God. Furthermore, if we look at the highest virtues of patience, we see that holiness entrusts the care of self-control to patience, it protects widows, seals virgins, and takes eunuchs to heaven. Virtue of the mind is perfected in the flesh and fights under persecution. If fleeing is necessary, the flesh struggles with the hardship of flight; if imprisoned, the flesh is in shackles, confined and alone in darkness and suffering from mistreatment. When we are tested for true happiness and must ascend the divine seat, we need patience more than anything else. If our spirit is willing but our flesh is weak, patience is the only thing that can keep us safe. The Lord says our flesh is weak to show that we need to strengthen it with patience to endure anything that could threaten or punish our faith—stripes, fire, crosses, beasts, and swords. With patience, prophets and apostles conquered these things.

## The power of spiritual and physical patience

Isaiah and Stephen showed great patience in their faithfulness to the Lord. Isaiah was cut apart and Stephen was stoned, yet they did not give up. How blessed is the one who faced all of the Devil’s violence with patience! He did not become discouraged when his cattle were taken away, his sheep were taken away, his children were taken away, and his own body was wounded. The Devil tried to make him turn away from God, but he did not give in. He is an example for us to follow so that we do not become discouraged when we suffer losses or physical pain. What a great example God set in the person of that hero! What a victory banner He raised over His enemy when, at every bitter message, that man uttered nothing but thanks to God, even while he denounced his own wife, who was exhausted from all the suffering. How God smiled and how the devil was cut down when Job kept scraping off the uncleanness of his wounds and replacing the vermin with his own pitted flesh! And so, when all temptations were stopped by his patience, God rewarded him with restored health and more than he had lost before. If he wanted to have his children back, he could have been called a father again, but he chose to wait until “that day” to experience the joy of having them back. He chose to suffer a voluntary loss so he could practice patience.

## Summary of the benefits and effects of patience

God is a very faithful depositary for our patience. If you wrong someone, He will avenge you; if you lose something, He will restore it; if you are in pain, He will heal you; and if you die, He will revive you. Patience is honored to have God as her debtor! It makes sense because she follows all of His commands. She strengthens faith, guides peace, helps charity, and encourages humility. She waits patiently for repentance and seals confession. She controls the flesh, protects the spirit, curbs the tongue, and holds back the hand. She crushes temptations and drives away scandals. She crowns martyrs with grace, comforts the poor, and teaches moderation to the rich. She respects the weak and doesn’t push the strong too hard. Believers adore her; she invites Gentiles; she commends servants to their lords and lords to God. She makes women beautiful and men honorable. Children love her; young people praise her; older people look up to her. She’s attractive in either sex, at any age. Now you can see what she looks like and what she does. Her expression was tranquil and peaceful; her forehead smooth and not troubled by any sadness or anger; her eyebrows relaxed in a happy way, with her eyes downcast in humility, not unhappiness; her mouth was sealed with the honorable mark of silence; her skin was like those who were without worry or guilt; she often shook her head against the devil and her laugh was threatening; her clothing around her chest was white and fitted to her body, not puffed up or disturbed. Patience sits on the throne of the calmest and gentlest Spirit, not found in a storm or a dark cloud, but with soft serenity, open and simple, like what Elijah saw on his third try. Where God is, Patience is there too. If we don’t welcome her along with the Spirit, will He stay with us? No, I don’t know if He will stay any longer. Without His friend and helper, He will be limited in every place and at all times. His enemy could hurt God and God won’t be able to handle it by himself, since he won’t have the help he needs.

## Heathen patience is different from Christian patience

This is the rule, this the discipline, and these are the works of true Christian patience, not the false and disgraceful patience of the nations of the earth. The devil has also taught his disciples a patience of his own; a patience that makes husbands venal for dowry and teaches them to trade in pandering, making them subject to their wives; a patience that is full of feigned affection and endures every toil of forced complaisance in order to ensnare the childless; and a patience that makes slaves of the belly submit to contumelious patronage, sacrificing their freedom for their gullet. Non-Christians understand patience, but they often use it to excuse bad behavior. They are patient with rivals, the rich, and those who invite them, but not with God. Let us, however, love the patience of God and Christ, and return the patience they have shown us. Let us show patience in our spirit and our body, believing in the resurrection of both.
