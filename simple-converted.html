      From
      <i> The Italian </i>
      (1797), Ann Radcliffe
    </h1>
    <p>
      Around 1764, some English travelers in Italy were touring the area around
      Naples when they came across the portico of the Santa Maria del Pianto, a
      church belonging to a very old convent of the order of the Black
      Penitents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The magnificent portico, though damaged by time, excited so much
      admiration that the travelers were curious to see the structure it
      belonged to. They ascended the marble steps leading to it.
