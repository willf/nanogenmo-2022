# Against Praxeas

1. The devil has shown hostility to the Truth in many ways. At times, he has pretended to defend it in order to undermine it. He is the champion of the one Lord, the Almighty, the creator of the world, so that he may make a heresy out of the unity. He says that the Father himself came down into the virgin, himself was born of her, himself suffered, in short himself is Jesus Christ. The serpent has forgotten himself: for when he tempted Jesus Christ after the baptism of John it was as Son of God that he attacked him, being assured that God has a son at least from those very scriptures out of which he was then constructing the temptation : If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread : again, If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down from hence, for it is written that he \- the Father, of course - hath given his angels charge concerning thee, that in their hands they should bear thee up, lest in any place thou dash thy foot against a stone. Or will he accuse the gospels of lying, and say, "Let Matthew and Luke see to it: I for my part approached God himself, I tempted the Almighty hand to hand: that was the reason for my approach, that was the reason for the temptation: otherwise, if it had been only God's son, perhaps I should not have demeaned myself to tempt him"? Nay but he himself rather is a liar from, the beginning, and so is any man whom he has suborned with his own coin, like Praxeas. For this person was the first to import to Rome out of Asia this kind of wrong headedness-a man generally of restless character, and moreover puffed up with boasting of his confessorship on account of nothing more than a mere short discomfort of imprisonment: though even if he had given his body to be burned he would have profited nothing, since he had not the love of God whose spiritual gifts he also drove out by assault. At that time, the bishop of Rome was about to recognize the prophecies of Montanus and Prisca and Maximilla. As a result, he was offering peace to the churches in Asia and Phrygia. But this man, by making false claims about the prophets and their churches, and by insisting on the decisions of the bishop's predecessors, forced him to recall the peace letters he had already sent out and to stop his plan to receive the spiritual gifts. So Praxeas caused two problems at Rome: he got rid of prophecy and introduced heresy. He chased away the Paraclete and crucified the Father. Praxean weeds were sown among the wheat and they germinated here too, while many people were asleep in their simple beliefs. Later they were found out, as God wanted, and they seemed to have been pulled up by the roots. The teacher guaranteed that he would change his ways and gave his word as collateral. His bond is still being held by the people he made the agreement with. After that, there was silence. I, later on, admitted that I supported the Paraclete and was separated from the people I made the agreement with. But by that time, the people who opposed us had already spread their influence everywhere. For a while, it was hidden, but now it has resurfaced. If the Lord is willing, we will get rid of it again. If not, then it will be dealt with in due time along with other offenses.

2. So, after all this time, a father who was born, a father who suffered, God himself the Lord Almighty, is preached as Jesus Christ. We, however, believe (as these do) in one only God, yet subject to this economy that the one only God has also a Son, his Word who has proceeded from himself, by whom all things were made; and without whom nothing has been made: that this Son was sent by the Father into the virgin and was born of her both man and God, Son of man and Son of God, and was named Jesus Christ: that he suffered, died, and was buried, according to the scriptures, and, having been raised up by the Father and taken back into heaven, sits at the right hand of the Father and will come to judge the quick and the dead: and that thereafter he, according to his promise, sent from the Father the Holy Spirit the Paraclete, the sanctifier of the faith of those who believe in the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. This rule has been around since the beginning of the gospel, before any other heretics. We can tell it's true because all the other heretics came later, and Praxeas is the newest one. So from now on, let's just assume that whatever came first is true, and whatever came later is fake. Still, we must allow room for further discussion on this topic, in case people think that each individual view is being condemned without being examined first - and in particular this view which thinks it impossible to believe in one God unless it says that both the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are one and the same. As though the one God were not all of these things in this way also, that they are all of one substance, while none the less the mystery of trinity is maintained, with the Father and the Son and the Spirit as three, three however not in quality but in sequence, not in substance but in appearance, not in power but in its manifestation, yet of one substance and one quality and one power, because it is one God from whom those sequences We calculate aspects and manifestations in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. How they can have plurality without division will become clear as we go along.

3. For all the simple people, that is, the thoughtless and ignorant (who are always the majority of the faithful), since the Rule of the Faith itself brings us over from the many gods of the world to the one only true God, they do not understand that while they must believe in one only God yet they must believe in him along with his economy. They claim that the plurality and ordinance of trinity is a division of unity - although a unity which derives from itself a trinity is not destroyed but administered by it. And so people put it about that by us two or even three gods are preached, while they, they claim, are worshippers of one God - as though unity irrationally summed up did not make heresy and trinity rationally counted out constitute truth. "We support", they say, "the monarchy": and even Latins express it so clearly and in such a masterful way, that you would think they understood monarchy as well as they pronounce it: but while Latins are intent on shouting out "monarchy", even Greeks refuse to understand the economy. But if I have gathered any small knowledge of both languages, I know that monarchy indicates neither more nor less than a single and sole empire, yet that monarchy because it belongs to one man does not for that reason make a standing rule that he whose it is may not have a son or must have made himself his own son or may not administer his monarchy by the agency of whom he will. No kingdom is so much one man's own that it can't be run by other closely related people whom the kingdom has chosen as officers. And if the man who owns the kingdom has a son, the kingdom doesn't automatically become divided, or stop being a monarchy, if the son is also given a role in it. The kingdom continues to belong first and foremost to the man who passes it on to his son. As long as it is his, it is still a monarchy, even though it is jointly held by two people who are so closely united. Therefore, even though the divine monarchy is administered by many legions and hosts of angels (as it is written, "Ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him and thousand thousands ministered unto him"), it has not stopped being a monarchy because it has so many thousand authorities as its provincial governors. So how could God, who in the Son and in the Holy Spirit occupies second and third place while being so closely united with the Father's substance, be thought to experience a division and dispersion such as he does not experience in the plurality of all those angels, who are not united with the Father's substance? Do you think that provinces and family connections and officials and all the forces and trappings of empire are the downfall of a monarchy? You are wrong if you do. I would rather you worry about the meaning of a fact than the sound of a word. The overthrow of monarchy happens when another kingship is established that is of a different character and quality, and therefore hostile, as when another god is introduced to oppose the Creator, as with Marcion, or many gods according to people like Valentinus and Prodicus. Then the monarchy is overthrown when it is destroyed by the Creator.

4. But how can I, who believe that the Son comes from the Father's substance and that he does nothing without the Father's will, and that he has received all authority from the Father - how can I be destroying the monarchy by my beliefs? Let this also apply to the third part of the Trinity, because I believe that the Spirit comes from the Father through the Son. Therefore, be careful that you are not the ones destroying the monarchy by overthrowing what God has ordained. Though there are three parts to the Trinity, it remains one, even though it has to be returned to the Father by the Son, as the apostle says about the end times: when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and Father. He must reign until God puts all his enemies under his feet, as it says in the Psalm, "Sit thou at my right hand until I make all thine enemies the footstool of thy feet." But when all things have been made subject to him, except him who has subjected all things to him, then also he himself will be subjected to him who has subjected all things to him, so that God may be everything to everyone. We see then that the Son is not prejudicial to the monarchy, although it is in his hands today, because it is both in its own quality in his hands, and retaining its own quality will be restored by the Son to the Father. Thus no one will on this account destroy it by admitting a Son, when it is agreed both that it has been delivered to him by the Father and that sometime it is to be restored by him to the Father. From this one passage in the apostle's letter, we have already been able to show that Father and Son are two. This is not only because of the names Father and Son, but also because the one who has delivered the kingdom and the one to whom he has delivered it, as well as the one who has subjected it and the one to whom he has subjected it, must necessarily be two.

5. But since some people insist that the Father and the Son are the same person, we must examine what the Bible says about the Son. Certain people say that the Hebrew Bible says, "In the beginning God made for himself a son." I don't agree with this because it goes against what God says in the Bible about himself. For before everything, God was alone. He was his own world and everything - but he was not lonely because he had with him the Reason that he had in himself. God is rational, and reason is primarily in him and thus from him are all things. Reason is his consciousness. This is what the Greeks call Logos, which we also designate as discourse. Consequently, our people are already accustomed to say, through the artlessness of the translation, that Discourse was in the beginning with God, even though it would be more appropriate to consider Reason of older standing, seeing that God is rational even before the beginning, and because discourse itself, having its foundation in reason, shows reason to be prior as being its substance. Yet even so it makes no difference. Although God had not yet spoken, he always had the Discourse within himself, along with and in his Reason. He silently thought out and ordained the things he was shortly to say with his Reason. And that you may understand this more easily, observe first from yourself how you also have reason within yourself. You are a rational animal not only because you were created by a rational Creator, but also because you were made from his substance and are a living soul. See how, when you reason with yourself, this same action takes place within you. Reason, accompanied by discourse, meets you at every thought, at every impression of your consciousness. Your every thought is discourse, and your every consciousness is reason. You must speak it in your mind, and while you speak it, you experience discourse which has in it this very reason by which you think. So in a way, you have in you as a second person discourse by means of which you think and by means of which you think by speaking. Discourse itself is another than you. Therefore, this action takes place more completely in God, whose image and similitude you are authoritatively declared to be, that even while silent he has in himself reason, and in that reason discourse. So I have been able to conclude without rashness that even then, before the universe was established, God was not alone, seeing he always had Reason in himself, and he made another Reason beside himself by his activity within himself.

6. This function and ordinance of the divine consciousness is also displayed in the scriptures under the name of Wisdom. For what is wiser than the Reason or Discourse of God? So listen also to Wisdom, established as a second person. First, The Lord created me as the beginning of his ways for his works' sake, before he made the earth, before the mountains were set in their places; yea, before all the hills he begat me - establishing and begetting, of course, in his own consciousness. Afterwards observe her, by the fact of being separate, standing by him: When he was preparing the heaven, she says, I was present with him, and as he made strong above the winds the clouds on high, and as he made safe the fountains of the earth which is under heaven, I was with him as a fellow-worker, I was she in whose presence he delighted; for daily did I delight in his person. When God first decided to create things, he decided to do it through his own power, using Wisdom, Reason, and Discourse. He created Discourse first, which contained Reason and Wisdom within it. This allowed the universe to come into existence through God's power alone, since he was the one who thought of and created it. The only thing that was lacking was for these things to be recognized and understood in their own species and forms.

7. Therefore, Discourse manifests and is equipped with sound and voice when God says, "Let there be light." This is the complete origin of Discourse, when it comes forth from God. It was first established by Him for thought under the name of Wisdom - "The Lord established me as the beginning of his ways." Then it was begotten for activity - "When he prepared the heaven I was present with him." Thereafter, causing Him to be His Father by proceeding from whom He became Son, the first-begotten as begotten before all things, the only-begotten as alone begotten out of God in a true sense from the womb of His heart, according as the Father Himself testifies, "My heart hath disgorged a good Discourse." And to Him thenceforth the Father Himself rejoicing says in His person, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee," and, "Before the daystar I begat thee." So the Son, under the name of Wisdom, confesses to the Father: "The Lord established me as the beginning of his ways for his works' sake, yea before the hills he begat me." If it appears in one place that Wisdom says she was established by the Lord for the sake of his works and ways, but it is revealed in another place that all things were made by Discourse and without him nothing was made - as well as in another place that the heavens were confirmed by the Discourse of the Lord and all their host by his Spirit - it is clear that it is the same function, now under the name of Wisdom, now under the designation of Discourse, which received the beginning of ways for God's works' sake, which confirmed the heaven, and by which all things were made without which nothing was made. And that's enough of that, because evidently, when we talk about the Wisdom and Reason and the whole divine mind and spirit, we are really talking about Discourse. He became the Son of God when he was generated by God. "So," you say, "you are saying that Discourse is some sort of substance, consisting of spirit and wisdom and reason." Certainly. Because you refuse to consider him an objective substance, as being a substance that is himself, so that he may be seen as an object and a person. And this would mean that, as he is another being besides God, he is capable of causing there to be two beings--the Father and the Son, God and the Word. For what is a word except voice and oral sound, and (as the grammarians' tradition has it) smitten air that is intelligible when heard? For the rest, a word is just an empty something, void and incorporeal. I affirm that nothing void or empty could have come from God - because the one from whom it came is not void or empty: and that which has come from such a great substance could not lack substance itself, and is the maker of such great substances. How could he be nothing without whom no thing was made? Could you describe as empty or void that Word of God whom scripture calls the Son, who is also designated as God? It is written, "You shall not take the name of God in vain." Certainly this is he who, being in the form of God, did not think it was robbery to be equal with God. What form does God have? Evidently some form, not none: for who will deny that God is a body, although God is a spirit? For spirit is body, of its own kind, in its own form. Moreover if those invisible things, whatever they are, have both their own body and their own shape in God's presence by which they are visible to God alone, how much more will that which has been sent forth from his substance not be devoid of substance. Therefore whatever the substance of the Word was, that I call a Person, and for it I claim the name of Son: and while I acknowledge him as Son I maintain he is another beside the Father.

8. If anyone thinks that I am introducing some kind of "projection" here, that is, that one thing is being created from another, like Valentinus does who creates one aeon from another, I will say to you that the Truth does not shy away from using that word and the concept it represents, just because heresy does. In fact, heresy has copied this concept from the Truth. The question we need to answer is who uses this concept and in what sense. Valentinus keeps his "projections" separate from their originator, and places them so far from him that an aeon knows nothing about its father. But eventually the projection wants to know the father, and is almost consumed and dissolved trying. With us, only the Son knows the Father, and he has declared the Father's will. He speaks only what he has been commanded by the Father, and he has accomplished not his own will but the Father's. For who knows the things which be in God, except the Spirit who is in him? But the Word consists of spirit, and (so to speak) spirit is the body of the Word. Therefore, the Word is always in the Father, as he says, "I am in the Father." And always with God, as it is written, "And the Word was with God." And never separate from the Father or other than the Father, because, "I and the Father are one." This will be the Truth's "projection," the guardian of unity, that projections by which we say that the Son was brought forth from the Father, but not made separate. For God brought forth the Word, as also the Paraclete teaches, as a root brings forth a ground shoot, and a spring brings forth a river, and the sun brings forth its beam: for these manifestations also are "projections" of those substances from which they proceed. Do not hesitate to say that the shoot comes from the root and the river comes from the spring and the beam comes from the sun, for every source is a parent and everything that is brought forth from a source is its offspring - and especially the Word of God, who also in an exact sense has received the name of Son: yet the shoot is not separate from the root nor the river from the spring nor the beam from the sun, any more than the Word is separate from God. Therefore, according to these examples, I say that God and his Word, the Father and his Son, are two: for the root and the shoot are two things, but joined; and the spring and the river are two manifestations, but not divided; and the sun and its beam are two aspects, but they are connected. Everything that comes from something must be another thing beside that from which it comes, but it is not for that reason separated from it. There is always a third thing that comes from two things. For example, the Spirit is the third thing that comes from God and his Son, just like how a fruit is the third thing that comes from a shoot, or how an irrigation canal is the third thing that comes from a river, or how an illuminated point is the third thing that comes from a beam of light. But even though the Spirit is the third thing that comes from God and his Son, he is not different from them in any way. In the same way, the Trinity (which is made up of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit) does not take away from the fact that God is the only ruler, even though it shows that there is more to God than just him being the ruler.

9. Remember that I have always said that the Father, Son, and Spirit are one and the same. If you understand this, then you will know what I mean when I say that the Father is one, the Son is another, and the Spirit is another. Some people misunderstand this and think that I am saying that the Father, Son, and Spirit are different from each other. But that is not what I am saying. I am saying that the Son is not the same as the Father, but they are both one and the same. The Father is the whole substance, while the Son is a part of the whole. The Son is less than the Father, as it says in the Psalm. The Father is different from the Son in the same way that the one who begets is different from the one who is begotten. When Jesus talked about the Holy Spirit, he was not talking about division but about order. The Holy Spirit is different from Jesus in the same way that Jesus is different from the Father. This preserves the way things are supposed to be. Is it not a fact that they are spoken of as Father and Son, which means they are two separate things? Surely all facts correspond with their designations, and there can be no confusion between different designations because that would mean confusion between the different things themselves. "Is" is "is" and "not" is "not": anything more than this is on the side of evil.

10. This means that you are either a father or a son, and day is not the same as night, nor is the Father the same as the Son in the sense that both are one person and each is both terms of the relationship, as those very silly monarchians will have it. They say that He Himself made Himself His own son. But no, a father makes a son, and a son makes a father, and those who become what they are by relationship with one another cannot by any means so become by relationship with themselves, as that a father should make himself his own son or a son cause himself to be his own father. The rules God has made, He Himself observes. A father must have a son in order to be a father, and a son must have a father in order to be a son. For to have is one thing, to be is another: for example, to be a husband I must have a wife, I shall not be my own wife. So also, in order to be a father I have a son, I shall not be my own son: and in order to be a son I have a father, I shall not be my own father. I am what I am because I have what I have. For example, I am a father because I have a son, and I am a son because I have a father. But if I am both a father and a son, then I am neither, because I don't have what I need to be either one. This is what the devil's ability boils down to: making the father and son destroy each other while pretending to please the monarchy. As a result, God is not a father because he has no son, and the Son is not a son because he has no father. This is how those in power keep the monarchy going - by keeping neither the Father nor the Son. "But", they say, "God can do anything." Who doesn't know that? And who isn't aware that things that are impossible for humans are possible for God? Also, God has chosen what is foolish in the world to embarrass what is wise. We've read all that. "Consequently", they say, "it wasn't difficult for God to make himself both father and son, which goes against the law that is traditional in human affairs. It wasn't difficult for God, against nature, to cause a barren woman to have a baby - or even a virgin." Of course, nothing is too difficult for God. But if we make rash assumptions about what God can do, we will be able to say that he has done anything we want, just because he has the power to do it. We must not believe that God has done something just because he can do anything. We need to find out if he actually did it. For example, God could have given people wings so they could fly, like he gave kites wings. But just because he could do it doesn't mean he did it. God could have immediately destroyed both Praxeas and all other heretics. But he didn't because he didn't want to. So there must be something that even God cannot do - something he refrained from doing, not because he couldn't do it, but because he chose not to. God's power is his will, and his inability is his absence of will. What his will was, that was in his power, and he has shown what it was. Therefore, because if he wished he could have made himself his own son, and because if he could he did it, you will prove that he could have done it and wished to do it only when you have proved that he did do it.

11. It will be your duty to prove that the scriptures identify the Son as being the same as the Father, just as we prove that the Father and Son are distinct from each other. Just as I allege that God said, "My heart hath disgorged a good Word," do you object that God somewhere said, "My heart hath disgorged myself as a good word," so that he himself may be both he who disgorged and what he disgorged, himself both he who brought forth and he who was brought forth, if he himself is Word and God? Look now, I allege that the Father said to the Son, "Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee": if you will have me believe that the Father himself is also the Son, show me that it is stated elsewhere in this form, "The Lord said to himself, I am my son, today have I begotten myself": consequently also, "Before the daystar have I begotten myself": and, "I the Lord have established myself as the beginning of ways for my works' sake, yea before all the hills have I begotten myself": and any others there are in this fashion. Before whose disapproval was God, the Lord of the universe, afraid of so stating it, if so the fact was? Or was he afraid that people wouldn't believe him if he plainly said that he was both the Father and the Son? There was one thing, however, that he was afraid of: to betray himself as the author of truth, and to betray his own truth. So, believing that God is true, I know that his statements are consistent with his ordinance, and his ordinance is consistent with his statements. You would make him a liar and a deceiver--someone who disappoints this faith of mine--if, being his own son, he assigned the role of son to another. This is because all the scriptures both demonstrate and make clear the Trinity. They are also the source of our standing rule that the speaker and the person spoken of and the person spoken to cannot be regarded as one and the same. That would be neither willful nor deceptive on God's part. Being himself the one spoken to, he should prefer to speak to himself instead of to another. Listen to what the Father says about the Son through the prophet Isaiah: "Look at my Son, whom I have chosen. I love him, and I am pleased with him. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will tell the nations what is right. Listen to what he says to him: 'You are my Son. Today I have become your Father. Ask me, and I will give the nations of the world to you as your inheritance. You will rule them with an iron rod. You will break them into pieces like pottery.' Listen also to what the Son says about the Father: 'The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has chosen me to preach good news to the poor. He has sent me to heal the brokenhearted and to announce that captives will be set free and blind people will see again. He has sent me to tell those who are sad that the time of the Lord's favor has come, and with it, the day of God's anger against their enemies.' Also, in a psalm, he speaks to the Father about the same Spirit: 'Do not abandon me until I have finished my work.' Also in another psalm: 'Lord, why are those who oppose me so many?'" Most of the psalms that talk about Christ represent him as speaking to God the Father. And notice that the Holy Spirit speaks about the Father and the Son in the third person: "The Lord said to my lord, 'Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies into a footstool for your feet.'" This is from Isaiah. And again, in the same prophet, the Holy Spirit speaks to the Father about the Son: "Lord, who has believed what we have said? And who has seen the arm of the Lord?" We have announced him like a young boy, like a root in a dry land. There was nothing special about him. These are just a few examples. We're not trying to list all the passages from Scripture that talk about this, because there are too many. But even just one passage is enough to show their complete majesty and authority. So we have the advantage in these discussions. So even though there are only a few texts that mention the Trinity, they still make it clear that each Person of the Trinity is distinct from the others. For example, the Spirit speaks about the Father and the Son, the Father speaks about the Son, and the Son speaks to the Father. These texts show that each Person is unique and not interchangeable with any of the others.

12. If you're still offended by the fact that the Trinity is three people instead of one, I ask you how it is that one single person speaks in the plural. In Genesis, God says, "Let us make man in our image and likeness," when he ought to have said, "Let me make man in my image and likeness," since he's one single person. Also, in what follows, when God says, "Behold, Adam has become like one of us," he's either being deceptive or joking when he speaks in the plural, while being one and alone and singular. Or was he speaking to the angels, as the Jews explain it, because they, like you, don't recognize the Son? Or, because he was himself father-son-spirit, did he for that reason make himself plural and speak to himself in the plural? No, rather, because there already was attached to him the Son, a second Person, his Word, and a third Person, the Spirit in the Word, for that reason he spoke in the plural. Who was he making man with, and how was he making him? He was speaking with the Son who would become human, and the Spirit who would sanctify man, as if they were ministers or mediators because of the unity of the Trinity. Then the scripture that follows makes a distinction between the Persons: And God made man, in the image of God made he him. Why wouldn't it say "his own image", if the maker was one, and there was no one in whose image he was making him? But there was someone in whose image he was making him, the Son's in fact. The Son, who was going to be the more certain and truer man, caused that man to be called his image who at that time had to be formed from clay, as the image and likeness of the true one. But also, in the preceding works of the world, how is it written? At first, while the Son is not yet on the scene, And God said, Let there be light, and it was made. The Word is the true light that enlightens the man who comes into this world. Through him, the mundane light also comes to bed. But from then on, with Christ as assistant and minister, God wanted things to be made, and God made them. So also, the rest of things were made by the same one who made the earlier things - that is, the Word of God, by whom all things were made and without whom nothing was made. And if he himself is God, as John says - the Word was God - you have two, one commanding a thing to be made, another making it. But you must understand "another" in the sense of person, not of substance, for distinctiveness, not for division. Although I always maintain that there is one substance in three that cohere, I must still, as a necessary consequence of the meaning of the passage, say that he who commands is other than he who makes. He would not be commanding if he himself were making while commanding things to be made. Yet he did command them to be made by him, since he would not have commanded himself if he had been one alone: or he would have made them without command, for he would not have waited to command himself.

13. "Consequently," you say, "if God spoke and God made, if one God spoke and another made, two gods are preached." If you are so stubborn, keep thinking that for a while. And, to give you more cause to think it, listen to how also in a psalm two are called gods: Your throne, O God, is forever, a scepter of direction is the scepter of your kingdom; you have loved righteousness and hate iniquity, wherefore God, even your God, has anointed you. If he is speaking to God, and to God anointed by God, here also he affirms that two are gods. Concerning this also Isaiah speaks, regarding the person of Christ, And the Sabaans, men of stature, shall come over to you and shall follow after you with their hands in chains and shall worship you because God is in you; for you are our God and we knew it not, O God of Israel. For here also, by saying God is in you, and You O God, he sets forth two, him who was in Christ, and Christ himself. It's more important that you find the same number in the Gospel: In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. There is one who "was," and another "within whom" he was. I also read that the name Lord is applied to two: The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand. And Isaiah says this: Lord, who hath believed our report, and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? For he would have said "thy arm," not "arm of the Lord," unless he had wished us to understand Lord the Father and Lord the Son. Also, in Genesis--which is even older--it says: And the Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire out of heaven from the Lord. Either deny that these things are written, or who are you to think they shouldn't be accepted as they are written, especially those which have their meaning not in allegories and parables but in clearly defined and simple statements? But if you're one of those people who didn't tolerate our Lord when he showed himself to be the Son of God, because you were afraid of having to believe that he is the Lord, remember, along with them, what is written: I said, "You are gods and sons of the Most High." And, "God stands in the congregation of the gods." So that, if scripture wasn't afraid to pronounce those men who by faith have been made sons of God to be gods, you should know that much more it has applied the name of God and Lord to the true and only Son of God. "Therefore," you say, "I will challenge you today, using the authority of those scriptures, to consistently preach two gods and two lords." God forbid. We, who are disciples of the Paraclete, not of men, examine the scriptures for what they say about the Father and the Son, and also the Holy Spirit. We believe there are three persons in the Godhead, because that is what the scriptures teach. However, we never say there are "two gods" or "two lords", because that would mean that when Christ came, he would be recognized as both God and Lord, which is not true. The scriptures show that there is only one God and one Lord. Christ is not both of God and of the Lord. If Christ were both of God and of the Lord, it would mean that the Father came down from heaven, which is not true. Christ is known as being the one who caused plurality by being made a second beside the Father and a third along with the Spirit. Through Christ, the Father is more fully made manifest. The name of God and of Lord is reduced to union, which means that there is only one God. This is different from worshipping many idols. It is also necessary that Christians should be bright in the world as sons of light. They should worship and call upon the name of the light of the world, one God and one Lord. Otherwise, if we knew that the name of God and Lord applies to both Father and Son and Spirit, and we called upon the name of gods and lords, we would put out our own light by being less bold in the face of martyrdom. For at every opportunity, we would have a chance to escape by immediately swearing by gods and lords, like certain heretics whose gods are more than one. So I will never say either "gods" or "lords", but I will follow the apostle. This way, if the Father and Son are mentioned together, I will call the Father "God" and name Jesus Christ "the Lord". But I will be able to call Christ God, as does the same apostle when he says, "Christ is God over all, blessed forever." For also the sun's beam, when by itself, I will call "the sun": but when naming the sun, whose the beam is, I will not immediately call the beam "the sun". For though I make two suns, yet the sun and its beam I will count as two objects, and two manifestations of one undivided substance, in the same sense as I count God and his Word, the Father and the Son.

14. We have the support of a rule that defines God as invisible in our vindication of the duality of the Father and the Son. For when Moses expressed a desire to see God in Egypt, saying, "If I have found grace in your sight, show yourself to me, that I may know you," God said, "You cannot see my face, for a man who sees it will die." We find that many people have seen God without dying. Of course, they saw God according to their capacity, not according to the fullness of his divinity. The patriarchs and prophets are reported to have seen God, but they did not die. Therefore, if they had seen him, they either should have died, because no one can see God and live, or the scripture would be wrong when it says that God said, "If a man sees my face he shall not live." But it's impossible for the same person who was seen to also be invisible. So we must understand that the Father is invisible because of his majesty, but we can see the Son because he came from the Father. Just like we can't look directly at the sun because it's too bright, but we can see its light because it's been dimmed when it reaches us on Earth. Here one of our opponents will say that the Son is also invisible as Word and as Spirit, and that because the Father and the Son are in the same situation, they are really one and the same. But we have shown that the scripture, by distinguishing between visible and invisible, proves that there is a difference. For they also say that when the Son was speaking to Moses, he said that no one could see his face, because he was really the invisible Father under the name of Son. And so they want the visible one and the invisible one to be seen as the same, just like they want Father and Son to be seen as the same, because earlier, before Moses was not allowed to see God's face, it says that the Lord spoke to Moses like a man speaks to his friend, and also that Jacob says, I have seen the Lord face to face. So the same person is both visible and invisible. And because that person has both attributes, then the invisible Father must be visible too, as the Son. As though the explanation of the scripture we offer doesn't, without mentioning the Father, fit the Son in his own visibility. We say that even now, the Son is invisible because of the nature of his being. But before he became human, he was visible in the way he appeared to Aaron and Miriam. He says that he will not appear to them in the same way he did with Moses, because Moses saw him face to face. Paul says that we see things dimly now, but we will see things clearly later. Therefore, since Moses only saw God's back and not His face, and since this was fulfilled later when Moses went up on the mountain (as we read in the Gospel that Moses was seen talking with Him), it is clear that, in the past, God - that is, the Son of God - was seen in a mirror and an enigma and a vision and a dream, both by prophets and patriarchs and Moses himself until that time. And if the Lord did speak in person, no one would see His face as it really is, but only in a mirror and in an enigma. Lastly, if the Lord spoke to Moses so that Moses knew what He looked like, why would he immediately ask to see His face? And why would the Lord deny that His face can be seen if He had let Moses see it? If there was a face which was seen - I have seen, says Jacob, God face to face and my life is preserved - there must be another face which slays if it is seen. Or is it that the Son indeed was seen - albeit in face, yet even this in a vision and a dream and a mirror and an enigma, because Word and Spirit cannot be seen except in imaginary aspect - yet by his face he means the invisible Father? For who is the Father? Shall he be the Son's face, on account of the authority which he obtains as, begotten of the Father? For is it not of some greater personage that it befits one to say, " That man is my face", or " He gives me face" ? The Father, he says, is greater than I : therefore the Father will be the Son's face. For also what says the scripture? The spirit of his countenance, Christ the Lord. So if Christ is the spirit of the Father's face, it's right that the Spirit would say that the person whose face it is, namely his Father, is his own face - clearly because they are one. Can you be surprised if the Father can be understood to be the Son's face, when he is his head? For the head of Christ is God.

15. If I can't find confirmation of our interpretation in the old scriptures, I'll look to the New Testament. I don't want you to claim everything I attribute to the Son as belonging to the Father. In both the gospels and the letters of the apostles, I see evidence of both a visible and an invisible God, with a clear distinction between the two. John seems to be saying that no one has ever seen God - not in the past, anyway. And the apostle Paul confirms this, saying that no one has ever seen God and no one ever will, because anyone who sees him will die. But then the same apostles say that they have seen Christ and even touched him. So if Christ is both Father and Son, how can he be both seen and unseen? In order to give one person this diversity of "seen" and "unseen", our adversary will argue that both are rightly spoken, since he was visible in the incarnation but invisible before the incarnation; and that consequently the Father, invisible before the incarnation, is the same Person as the Son, visible in the incarnation. And yet, if the same Person was invisible before the incarnation, how is it he is found to have been seen also before the incarnation? Equally, if the same Person is visible after the incarnation, how is he even now pronounced invisible by the apostles, unless there is one whom, seen before in an enigma, the incarnation has made more fully visible - the Word in fact, who also was made flesh - and another whom no one has ever seen - the Father in fact, whose the Word is? Once for all let us examine who it was the apostles saw. John says that we have seen and heard the Word of life with our own eyes and hands. This is because the Word of life became flesh and was seen and heard and touched by people. But before the incarnation, when the Word was only God, he was in the presence of God the Father, not the other way around. This is because, although the Word was God, he was still in the presence of God, since he was God from God and was with the Father. And we saw his glory, which is the glory of the only begotten Son of the Father. John says this so that people will not think that he saw the Father himself, but to show that there is a difference between the invisible Father and the visible Son. The Word? But it was said before, we have seen and heard and handled the Word of life. But which God? Obviously the Father, in whose presence the Word, the only-begotten Son, who himself has declared the Father's bosom, was God. He himself was both heard and seen, and lest he should be taken for a phantom, was even handled. Paul also had sight of him, yet he saw not the Father. Have I not seen Jesus? But he also has applied the name of God to Christ: Whose are the fathers, and out of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all, blessed forever. He also presents the Son of God, that is, the Word of God, as visible because he who was made flesh is called Christ. But of the Father he says to Timothy, Whom no one has seen or can see: and he goes on to say that this is the same God Who alone has immortality and is unapproachable light. And of the Son he says the opposite - that he is mortal and approachable. He testifies that the Son died according to scripture, and was seen by himself last of all - evidently in approachable light. Though even that experience was dangerous to his sight, as it was also for Peter and John and James, who were astonished and nearly lost their reason. If they had seen not the glory of the Son who was to suffer, but the Father, I think they would have died on the spot: for no one can see God and live. This means that the one who was seen at the beginning and at the end was always the Son, and the one who was not seen at the end was never seen at the beginning. Therefore, it was always the Son who was seen, who talked, and who did things by the Father's authority and will. The Son can't do anything on his own unless he sees the Father doing it in his consciousness. The Father does things with consciousness, while the Son sees and does what is in the Father's consciousness. So everything was made by the Son, and without him nothing was made.

16. And do not think that only the works of the world were made by the Son. The Father loves the Son and has given him all things. The Word was with God from the beginning and is God. The Father has given him all power over everything. So it is the Son who, from the beginning, has judged the world. He came down to talk with people from Adam to the patriarchs and prophets. He was learning how to be God with people. But he also did this so that we would have an easier time believing that the Son of God came down into the world. For, as things were written, so also they were done, for our sake upon whom the ends of the world are come. He knew human emotions at that time, as he was going to take on human form, asking Adam a question as though he did not know - Adam, where are you? - repenting that he had made man, as though he had no foreknowledge; tempting Abraham, as though ignorant of what is in a man; angry, and reconciled with the same persons; and all those things which heretics, for the destruction of the Creator, say are unworthy of God, ignorant that these things befitted the Son, who was also going to experience human emotions, both thirst and hunger and tears and nativity itself and death itself. But the heretics will refuse to even consider these things proper for the Son, with which you becloud the Father himself, as though he had made himself lower for our sake, even though the scripture says that one was made lower by another, not himself by himself. Moreover, one was crowned with glory and honor, and another crowned him, evidently the Father crowning the Son. Besides, how can it be that God Almighty, that invisible one whom none of men has seen nor can see, he who dwells in light unapproachable, he who dwells not in things made with hands, before whose aspect the earth trembles, and the mountains melt as wax, who grasps the whole world in his hand like a nest, whose throne is the heaven and the earth his footstool, in whom is all space but he not in space, who is the boundary line of the universe, he the Most High, should have walked in paradise in the evening looking for Adam, should have shut up the ark after Noah had gone in, should have rested under an oak with Abraham, should have called to Moses from the burning bush, and should have appeared with three others in the Babylonian king's furnace - although it says he was a son of man? These things couldn't be true about the Son of God unless they were written down, and maybe not even then. But these people say he was born to Mary, put on trial by Pilate, and buried in Joseph's tomb. They're obviously wrong. They don't realize that everything that has happened since the beginning was done by the Son, not the Father. The Father is eternal and can't die or be buried, according to what the prophet said. So it's the Son who has always done everything that's been done in his name.

17. They have found it easier to think that the Father has acted in the Son's name than the Son in the Father's, even though the Lord himself says, "I am come in my Father's name." And again, to the Father himself he says, "I have manifested thy name to men." And the scripture also agrees: "Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord" - evidently the Son in the name of the Father. And the Father's name is "God Almighty," the "Most High," the "Lord of hosts," the "King of Israel," and "I am." Inasmuch as the scriptures so teach, we say that these also have applied to the Son, and that in these the Son came, and in these always acted, and thus in himself manifested them to men. All things that the Father has, he says, are mine: and why not also the names? When you read about God Almighty, the Most High, the God of hosts, and the King of Israel in the Bible, beware of people who say that these titles also apply to Jesus. They will say that Jesus is God Almighty because he is the Word of God Almighty and has power over all things; that he is the Most High because he was exalted by God to his right hand; that he is the Lord of Hosts because all things are subjected to him by the Father; that he is the King of Israel because he was especially chosen by God for that nation; and also "I am" because there are many who are called sons but are not. But if they want to say that Christ's name is also the Father's, they will hear my answer in its proper place. In the meantime, let this be my response to what they say based on the Revelation of John: "I am the Lord, who is and who was and is to come, the Almighty." And wherever else they think the designation "Almighty" is not appropriate to the Son: as if he who is to come were not Almighty, when the Son of the Almighty is no less Almighty than the Son of God is God.

18. But they are thrust out of the way of easily seeing in the Son this partnership in the Father's names by those occasions when the scripture has stated that God is one alone-as though the same scripture had not set before us two Gods and Lords, as we have already shown. Therefore, say they, because we find two as well as one, consequently both are one Person, and the same one is both Son and Father. Surely the scripture is not in such jeopardy that you have to come to its rescue by your quibbling to prevent it from appearing to be contrary to itself: it is correct both when it states that God is one only and when it reveals Father and Son as two, and it needs no help but its own. It is agreed that by it the name of the Son is mentioned: for without prejudice to the Son it can be right in having defined as one only, God whose son the Son is. The father is the first person, and the son is named after him. Therefore, there is one God, the Father, and the Son is not another god than the Father. The Son is indivisible and inseparable from the Father, so he must be accounted as in the Father even when his name is not mentioned. And, if he had mentioned him, he would have made him separate - if he had spoken in this way, "Beside me there is no other god except my Son," it would have been as if he were making the Son another god by excepting him from those others who are no gods. Imagine the sun saying, "I am the sun and beside me there is no other except my beam." Would you not have remarked adversely upon his futility, as though the beam were not accounted in the sun? In the same way, the statement that besides himself there is no other god is made because of the idolatry of both the gentiles and of Israel: also because of the heretics, who manufacture idols with words as the gentiles do with their hands - that is, another God and another Christ. Therefore, even when he pronounced himself as one with the Father, he was serving the Son's interest, lest Christ should be believed to have come from any other God than him who had already said, "I am God, and there is no other God beside me," God who reveals himself as one only, yet one only with the Son, with whom also he alone has spread out the heaven.

19. Yes, and also this saying of his they will seize upon for a proof of his singularity. I alone, he says, have spread out the heaven - alone in respect of the other powers, erecting a barrier against the guesses of the heretics, who will have it that the world was built by angels and hostile powers, heretics who make the creator himself either an angel or one suborned for other external acts, like the making of the world, and ignorant at that. Or if in their sense he alone spread out the heaven, why do these present heretics perversely assume the exclusion of that singular Wisdom who says, When he prepared the heaven I was present with him? And if one has said, Who hath known the mind of the Lord and who hath been his counsellor?, evidently he means "besides Wisdom who was present with him". In him, however, and with him she fashioned all things, seeing he was not ignorant what he was doing. But "besides Wisdom" means "besides the Son", who is Christ the Wisdom and the Power of God, as the apostle says. He is the only one who knows the mind of the Father: for who knows the things which be in God; except the Spirit which is in him? - not which is outside him. There was then one who made God not alone, except as alone in respect of other gods. But also let the Gospel be refused a hearing because it says that all things were made by God through the Word, and that without him was nothing made. For, if I am not mistaken, it is also written elsewhere: By his Word were the heavens established, and all their powers by his Spirit. But the Word also, the Power and the Wisdom, will himself be the Son of God. Thus if all things are by the Son, when he spreads out the heaven also by the Son he is not alone in spreading it out, except on that reckoning that he is alone in respect of the other gods. And so he immediately speaks about the Son: Who else has destroyed the idols of the fortune-tellers and the magic arts, and turned the wise people backward and made their advice foolish? - by saying, of course, "This is my beloved Son, listen to him." By adding the Son like this, he shows that he himself is the one who alone has spread out heaven - that is, alone with his Son, just as he is one thing with his Son. And furthermore, it will be the Son's voice that says "I alone have spread out heaven," because it was by the Word that heaven was established: because with the help of Wisdom in the Word, heaven was prepared, and because all things were made by the Word, it is possible for the Son also to have spread out heaven alone, because he was the only one who assisted the Father's operation. He will also be the one who says "I am the first, and I am he who is to come." It's clear that the Word is the first thing of all: In the beginning was the Word, and in that beginning he was brought forth by the Father. The Father had no beginning, since he was brought forth by no one and was unborn. So he can't be seen as first. Someone who was always alone couldn't have a numerical order. So if their reason for thinking the Father and the Son are the same is that they want to prove the unity of God, then they're wrong. The unity of God is proved by the fact that he, being one, also has a Son who is just as much included in the same scriptures as the Father is. If they are unwilling for the Son to be seen as equal to the Father, because they think this would mean there are two Gods, we have shown that even the Bible refers to two Gods and two Lords. But we are not saying that there are two Gods or two Lords. We are saying that the Father and the Son are two, not because they are different substances, but because of their relationship. And even though the Son is called God when he is named by himself, this does not mean there are two Gods. There is only one God, because the Son is united with the Father.

20. But to further refute their quibbles, we must pay attention to whatever they can find in the new scriptures to support their opinion, while they refuse to look at other passages which also follow the rule, and which protect the divine unity and the authority of the monarchy. For just as in the old scriptures they only retain what is said about God - "I am God, and there is no one else" - so in the Gospel they uphold the Lord's answer to Philip: "I and the Father are one," and "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father," and "I am in the Father and the Father is in me." They want the whole of both testaments to yield to these three citations, even though the smaller number should be interpreted in accordance with the greater. But this is the characteristic of all heretics. They only look at a few cases that they can find and then they make a rule based on those few cases.

21. See, then, how many examples there are in the Gospel of people being before Philip was consulted, and before all your quibbling. To begin with, the very beginning of John's Gospel shows what the one who had to be made flesh had been like before: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; he was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was nothing made. If we can't understand this any other way than as it is written, then it's clear that one is revealed who was from the beginning, and another with whom he was. The reveals one as the Word of God, and God another-though the Word is also God, but as God's Son, not as the Father: one through whom are all things, another by whom are all things. But what we mean by "another" we have already often explained. When we say "another" we necessarily mean "not the same": "not the same" however not as separated, another by ordinance, not by division. Therefore, it was he who was made flesh, not the one whose Word he was. His was the glory seen, as if he were the only one of the Father, not as if he were the Father. He, the only one, has revealed the bosom of the Father, not the Father his own bosom: for it says first, "No one has seen God at any time." Therefore even if he is pointed out by John as the Lamb of God, he is not pointed out as the one whose beloved he is. Certainly he is always God's Son, not the one whose Son he is. Nathanael immediately perceived this about him, as well as did Peter elsewhere: "You are the Son of God." And that they rightly perceived this, he himself confirms by replying to Nathanael, "Because I said I saw you under the fig tree, therefore you believe;" and by affirming the blessedness of Peter, to whom not flesh or blood had revealed what he had perceived about the Father as well as the Son, but the Father who is in heaven. And by this saying he determined the distinction of both Persons, the Son on earth whom Peter had recognised as God's Son, and the Father in heaven who had revealed to Peter what Peter had recognised, that Christ is God's Son. When he has entered into the Temple he calls it his Father's house, as a son would. When he speaks to Nicodemus he says, God so loved the world that he gave his only Son that every one who believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life : and again, For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him; he that believeth in him is not judged; he that believeth not in him is, judged already; because he hath not believed in the name of the only Son of God. When John was asked what he thought of Jesus when he was baptizing, he said, "The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand; whoever believes in the Son has eternal life; whoever does not believe in the Son of God will not see God, but the wrath of God will remain upon him." To whom did he reveal himself to the Samaritan woman? If it was the Messiah who is called Christ, evidently he showed himself to be the Son, not the Father, for elsewhere also Christ is called the Son of God, not the Father. Thereafter to the disciples he says, "It is my job to do the will of him who sent me, so that I may accomplish his work." And to the Jews concerning the healing of the paralytic he says, "My Father is still working, and I am working too." "My father and I" is what a son says. In the end, this is why the Jews sought to kill him even more, not only because he violated the Sabbath, but because he called God his Father, making himself equal with God. So he said to them, "The Son can't do anything on his own, except what he sees the Father doing. The things the Father does, the Son also does. The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. And the Son will do even greater things than these, so you will be amazed. For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so the Son gives life to anyone he wants. And the Father doesn't judge anyone. He has given that all to the Son, so that everyone will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. If you don't honor the Son, you don't honor the Father who sent him." I tell you the truth, anyone who hears my words and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life. They will not be judged guilty because they have already passed from death into life. I tell you the truth, the time is coming when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God. They who have heard it will live. Just as the Father has eternal life in himself, he has given that same life to the Son to have in himself. And he has given the Son the power to judge because he is the Son of Man--because he became human, as well as being the Son of God through God's Spirit. Then Jesus said, "I have a greater witness than John's. The works that the Father has given me to do prove that he sent me." And the Father himself has testified about me. But when Jesus said, "You have never heard his voice or seen his form," he was referring to a time before when it was not the Father but the Son who was seen and heard. At last he says, "I have come in my Father's name, but you have not accepted me. Therefore, the Son was always in the name of God and King and Lord Almighty and Most High." To those who asked him what they must do, he replied, "Believe in him whom God has sent." He also affirms that he is the bread which the Father provided from heaven: consequently, everything which the Father gave him came to him, and he would not reject it because he had come down from heaven not to do his own will but the Father's. The Father's will was that those who see the Son and believe in him may have life and resurrection. Furthermore, no one can come to him unless the Father draws him, and everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to him. At this point he also adds, "Not that anyone has seen the Father," so that he might show that he was the Father's Word by whom people become taught. But when many people left him, and he gave his disciples the chance to leave if they wanted to, what did Simon Peter say? Where are we going? You have the words of life, and we believe that you are the Christ. Did he mean that he is the Father, or the Father's Christ?

22. But whose doctrine does he say it was at which they marvelled? His own, or the Father's? Likewise when they were in doubt among themselves whether he were not the Christ - evidently not the Father but the Son - he says, You both know me and you know where I come from, and I am not here on my own. He is true that sent me, whom you do not know: I know him because I am with him. He does not say, Because I am he, or, I have sent myself, but, He has sent me. Also when the Pharisees had sent to attack him, he said, I will be with you for a little while longer, and then I go to him that sent me. But when he says he is not alone - But I, he says, and the Father that sent me - does he not point to two, as much two as inseparable? Yes, this was the whole of his teaching, that there are two, inseparable: since also while citing the law which confirms the witness of two men, he adds, I bear witness concerning myself, and the Father who sent me beareth witness concerning me. But if there had only been one Person, the same one being both Son and Father, he would not have needed the advocacy of the law, which requires belief in the testimony of two witnesses. Also, when asked where the Father was, when he replied that neither he nor the Father was known to them, he spoke of two unknowns. But if they had known him, they would have known the Father. Not that he himself was Father and Son, but because their indivisibility means that one cannot be known or unknown without the other. The one who sent me, he says, is true. And the things I have heard from him, those I also speak to the world. The scripture explains in a digression that they didn't know he had spoken to them of the Father. Though of course they ought to have known that the Father's words are in the Son, by reading in Jeremiah, "And the Lord said to me, Behold I have put my words in thy mouth." And in Isaiah, "The Lord giveth me the tongue of discipline to know when it is right to speak a word." As he himself says again in John, "Then shall ye know that I am he, and that of myself I speak nothing, but as he hath taught me so also I speak, because also he is with me that hath sent me." So much concerning the witness of two who are indivisible. Jesus was arguing with the Jews, saying that they only wanted to kill him because he was telling the truth about God. He said, "I speak only what I have seen with my Father. But you do what you have seen with your father." In other words, they only wanted to kill him because he was speaking the truth about God, and they weren't really interested in God himself. When Jesus says that Abraham saw his day and rejoiced, he is showing that the Son was seen by Abraham in the past, not the Father. Also, when he is talking to the blind man, he says that the man must do the Father's works. And after the man's eyes are healed, Jesus asks him if he believes in the Son of God. When the man asks who Jesus is, and Jesus points to himself, he is pointing to the Son. Later, Jesus says that he is known by the Father and loved by the Father because he is obedient, even though it means giving up his life. When the Jews asked him if he was the Christ, he said that his works prove it. What witness? The person they were asking about, that is, the Christ of God. And concerning his sheep, that no one would snatch them from his hand, he says, For what the Father hath given me is greater than they all; and, I and the Father are one. Here then they wish to make a stand, these fools, yea blind, who see not, first, that "I and the Father" is an indication of two; secondly, at the end of the sentence, that "are" is not from the person of one, because it is spoken in the plural; and then, that he says "are one thing", not "are one person ". For if he had said "are one person " he would have been able to assist their case: for "one person" is apparently an indication of the singular number. Yet when he says that two, of the masculine gender, are one thing, in the neuter-which is not concerned with singularity but with unity, with similitude, with conjunction, with the love of the Father who loves the Son, and with the obedience of the Son who obeys the Father's will-when he says, One thing I and the Father are, he shows that those whom he equates and conjoins are two. Consequently he adds that he has shown them also many works from the Father, none of which deserved stoning. And so that they should not think they ought to stone him on the ground that he had wished himself to be taken for God himself, that is, the Father, because he had said I and the Father are one, by way of showing that he is God, the Son of God, not by way of showing that he is God himself, he says, If it is written in the law, I said, Ye are gods, and the scripture cannot be relaxed, say ye of him whom the Father hath sanctified and sent into the world, that he blasphemeth, because he said, I am the Son of God? If I do not do the works of my Father, believe not; but if I do them and ye will not believe me, believe even for the works' sake, and know that I am in the Father and the Father in me. By means of the works, then, the Father will be in the Son and the Son in the Father, and thus by means of the works we understand that the Father and the Son are one. He insisted so strongly on this that we should believe there are two, even though they are one in power, because it would be impossible to believe there is a Son unless we believe there are two.

23. After this, Martha confessed that Jesus was the Son of God. She was no more confused than Peter and Nathanael. If she had been confused, she would have learned the truth right away. For the Lord, in order to raise Martha's brother from the dead, looked up to heaven and spoke to the Father. He said, "Father, I thank you for always hearing me. I said this in front of all these people so that they would believe that you sent me." Jesus was troubled in his soul. He thought, "What should I say? Father, save me from this hour." But then he realized that he came into this world for this very reason. So he said, "Father, glorify your name." And the Son was in that name. He said, "I have come in my Father's name." Afterward, the Son's word to the Father would have been enough-behold, the Father answers the Son from heaven; and, as he had already testified, "This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear him," so here again he says, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again." How many Persons do you think there are, self-opinionated Praxeas, if not as many as there are voices? You have the Son on earth, you have the Father in heaven. That is no separation, but a divine ordinance. Yet we know that God is even within the depths, and takes up his position everywhere-though in function and power-and that the Son also, as inseparable, is with him everywhere. Yet in the economy itself it was the Father's will that the Son should be regarded as on earth, but himself in heaven. And the Son looked up and prayed and asked the Father for help - where he also taught us to lift ourselves up and pray, "Our Father who art in heaven" - even though he is also everywhere. This is what the Father wants for his home: "The heaven," he says, "is my throne." From this he also made the Son a little less than the angels by sending him down to earth, yet with the intention of crowning him with glory and honor by taking him back into heaven. This he was already granting him when he said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it." The Son makes a request from earth, and the Father makes a promise from heaven. Why do you make both the Father and Son liars? If the Father was speaking to the Son from heaven while being himself the Son on earth, or if the Son was praying to the Father while being himself the Father in heaven, how could the Son also make a request of himself, as if the Father were the Son? And how could the Father make a promise to himself, as if the Son were the Father? Even if we spoke of two people who are divided from each other, as you say we do, it would be better than preaching about one chameleon god. This is what the Lord meant when he said, This voice came not for my sake but for your sakes. He wanted the monarchians to believe in both the Father and the Son, each in his own name and person and location. But then Jesus cries out and says, "The person who believes in me is not really believing in me. They're believing in the one who sent me. Because it's through the Son that they believe in the Father. And the Father is the reason they believe in the Son. The one who sees me is seeing the one who sent me. How is that? Surely because I haven't spoken on my own behalf. The Father who sent me has told me what to say and what to speak. I speak the words that he has given me, just as he told me to." The evangelist, who was John himself, knew this better than Praxeas did. So he says on his own behalf, "Before the Passover feast, Jesus knew that everything had been given to him by the Father. He knew that he had come from God and was going back to God." Praxeas believes that the Father came from himself and left to be by himself. This means that when Judas betrayed Jesus, he was actually betraying the Father. But neither the devil nor Praxeas benefited from this because, as the scripture says, "Now the Son of Man is glorified and God is glorified in him." This means that it was not the Father that Judas betrayed, but the Word of the Father who was in the Son of Man. And after Jesus had been glorified through his resurrection, he said that the Father would also glorify him.

24. Some people clearly didn't understand what Thomas was saying. Thomas was unbelieving for a while and said, "Lord, we don't know where you are going or how we will get there." And Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you had known me, you would have known the Father too. But from now on you do know him and have seen him." Then we come to Philip who, hoping to see the Father, said, "Show us the Father and that will be enough for us." And the Lord said, "Philip, I have been with you for a long time. How is it that you don't know me?" In other words, he was saying that they should have known who he was. This is the only thing that needs to be discussed. Should they have known him as the Father or as the Son? If as the Father, let Praxeas tell us how Christ, after spending so much time with them, could not only be thought of as the Father, but even be thought to be the Father. All the scriptures determine this: the old scriptures speak of the Christ of God, and the new scriptures speak of the Son of God. This was preached long ago and also stated by Christ himself. Now the Father openly confesses the Son from heaven and glorifies him, saying, "This is my Son, and I have glorified him, and I will glorify him." The disciples believed this, but the Jews did not. Christ wanted them to believe that he was the Son, so he constantly named the Father and spoke of him, honoring him. If that is so, then it was not the Father whom they did not know, even though he had been with them for a long time. Rather, it was the Son whom they did not know. The Lord upbraided them for not recognizing him, even though they had been with him for a long time. He wanted them to recognize that he was the Son. Now it is clear what it means when it says, "He who sees me sees the Father also." It means that I and the Father are one. I came from God, and anyone who wants to come to the Father must come through me. The Father gave everything to me, and he is the one who makes people alive. If you know me, then you also know the Father. Philip was told that he would see the Father by means of acts of power, not by actually seeing his person. Furthermore, if he wished the identity of the Father and the Son to be understood by saying "He who sees me sees the Father," why did he add, "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me?" He should have added, "Do you not believe that I am the Father?" Or why did he elaborate on it, except to make clear what he wished them to understand, namely that he was the Son? Furthermore, in saying "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me," he elaborated on it for this reason rather, lest, on the grounds that he had said "He who has seen me has seen the Father also," he might be thought to be the Father: and this he never wished to be thought to be, for he always professed to be the Son, and to have come from the Father. Therefore he also made manifest the conjunction of the two Persons, so that the Father separately might not, as though visible, be asked for in open view, and that the Son might be accepted as he who makes the Father present. He also explained how the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father. He said that the words I speak to you are not mine, because they are the Father's. The Father does powerful works and teaches through me, and you can see the Father in me through those things. Each Person is himself and no one else. So believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me, because of the works themselves.

25. After Philip and the whole context of that question, the things which follow down to the end of the gospel continue in the same kind of discourse, in which the Father and the Son are distinguished as being each himself. He promises that when he has ascended to the Father he will also request of the Father the Paraclete, and will send him, specifying another. But we have already explained in what sense the means "another". Moreover he says, He will take of mine, as I myself have taken of the Father's. So the close series of the Father in the Son and the Son in the Paraclete makes three who cohere, the one attached to the other: And these three are one thing, not one person, in the sense in which it was said, I and the Father are one, in respect of unity of substance, not of singularity of number. Take a quick look and you will find that the person you think is the Father is called the Father's vine, and the Father is the farmer, just as you will find that the person you think was on earth was acknowledged by the Son to be in heaven when he looked up there and commended his disciples to the Father. But although in this gospel there is no revelation of my God, why have you abandoned me? Father, I lay down my spirit in your hands. But after the resurrection and the glory of conquering death, when he no longer needed to be humble and could show himself to be the Father to the woman who tried to touch him out of affection and not curiosity or Thomas's unbelief, he said, "Don't touch me, because I haven't gone up to my Father yet. But go to my brothers and tell them I am ascending to my Father and your Father, my God and your God." Father to Father, and God to God? Or Son to Father, and Word to God? Also, what reason does the very end of the gospel give for these things that are written, except that you may believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God? Therefore, if you think any of these things will help you prove that the Father and Son are the same person, you are going against what the gospel says. The things were written so that you would believe that Jesus Christ is the Son, not the Father.

26. We seem to have studied John's Gospel thoroughly, so that Philip's one remark and the Lord's reply to it should not overturn all the other things that are clearly stated in the Gospel, before and after. We should interpret Philip's remark in a way that is consistent with everything else in the Gospel, not in a way that contradicts it. We don't need to rely on the other Gospels to confirm our faith - the angel who announced the birth of Jesus to the Virgin Mary called him the Son of God. Some people will try to argue with this, but the truth will prevail. They say, "It's clear that the Son of God is God, and that the power of the Most High is the Most High." They're not ashamed to say this, even though it's not written that way. The reason it's not written that way is that God didn't want him to say it outright. When he said "The Spirit of God," he meant that the whole thing belonged to the Son. This Spirit of God is the same as the Word. Just as we understand that the Word is also the Spirit when John says "The Word was made flesh," we understand here that the Word is also the Spirit. Spirit is the substance of the Word, and Word is an operation of the Spirit, and they're one and the same. Otherwise, there will be someone whom John declares to have been made flesh, and another whom the angel says will be flesh. If it is not the case that both the Spirit and the Word are the same, then it is not clear that when a thing is "from him" and is "his" in the sense that it is from him, that it can be a thing which is like him from whom it is and whose it is. Consequently, the Spirit is God and the Word is God, because he is from God, yet is not God himself from whom he is. But if the Spirit of God is not God himself, but is something that comes from God, then the power of the Most High will not be the Most High himself. Power is an attribute of spirit, and will not itself be spirit. Since the Spirit of God and his power were given to the virgin, what was born of her is the Son of God. This is what he himself testified when he was a boy: "Don't you know that I must be in my Father's house?" This is also what Satan knew at the temptations: "If you are the Son of God." This is also what the devils confessed later: "We know who you are--the Son of God." He prays to the Father. When Peter recognizes him as the Christ, he doesn't deny it. When he rejoices in the Spirit, he says to the Father, "I thank you, Father, that you have hidden these things from the wise." In the same passage, he also affirms that the Father is known only to the Son, and that the Son of the Father will, in the presence of the Father, confess those who confess him and deny those who deny him. He introduces the parable of a son, not a father, who was sent into a vineyard after a number of servants had been sent and was killed by wicked rustics and avenged by his father. He even himself does not know the last day or hour, which is known only to the Father. He ordains for his disciples a kingdom, just as he says one has been ordained for him by his Father. He has the power to ask his Father for legions of angels to help him, if he wished. He cries aloud that God has forsaken him and places his spirit in the Father's hands. After the resurrection, he pledges himself to send to his disciples the promise of the Father. Lastly, he commands them to baptize in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, not just in one name. For we are not Each person is baptized in their own name.

27. Why should I waste time on things that are so obvious, when I should be attacking the arguments that they use to try to make these things seem confusing? They are convicted on all sides by the clear distinction between the Father and the Son, which we say exists without disturbing the permanence of the union, just like the sun and its rays, or a spring and the river that flows from it. But instead of accepting this clear distinction, they try to interpret it in another way that still allows them to say that the Father and the Son are the same person. They say that the Son is the flesh, that is, the man Jesus, while the Father is the Spirit, that is, God, Christ. So those who say that the Father and the Son are one and the same are now dividing them rather than calling them one. For if Jesus is one and Christ is another, then the Son will be one and the Father another, because Jesus is the Son and Christ is the Father. This sort of monarchy they perhaps, learned of from Valentinus, to make two of Jesus and Christ. But this assumption of theirs has already been disproven by our previous discussion, because he whom they make the Father is described as the Word of God, or the Spirit of God and the power of the Most High: for these are not he to whom they are described as belonging, but are from him and belong to him. Yet they will be refuted also in another way in that text. " Behold", they say, " it was announced by the angel, Therefore that which shall be born of thee shall be called holy, the Son of God : and so it was flesh that was born, and so the flesh will be the Son of God." And yet the statement was made concerning the Spirit of God. For certainly it was of the Holy Spirit that the virgin conceived, and what she conceived that she brought to birth. So the Spirit must have been born, who was conceived and was to be born. This is the Spirit whose name will also be called Emmanuel, which means "God with us." But flesh is not God, and it shouldn't be said that it will be called holy, the Son of God. Rather, the one who was born as God in flesh is the one the psalm speaks of: "Because God as man was born in her and has built her by the will of the Father." Who, being God, was born in her? The Word, and the Spirit who was born with the Word by the Father's will. So the Word is in flesh. We also have to ask how the Word became flesh: whether He transformed into flesh or put on flesh like a garment. Certainly He put on flesh like a garment. But we must necessarily believe that God is unchanging and cannot be transformed, because He is eternal. But if something changes form, it is destroyed. For example, when water becomes ice, it is no longer water. And if God changed form, He would cease to be God. But the Bible says that God never changes. So we must understand that when the Bible says that "the Word became flesh," this means that the Word took on a human body and could be seen and touched. If the Word became flesh as a result of a transformation or mutation of substance, then Jesus will be one substance made up of two things, flesh and spirit. He will be neither flesh (that is, spirit) nor spirit (that is, flesh), because one thing has been changed by the other. In that case, Jesus will not be God, because he has stopped being the Word. And his human nature will not be flesh, because it is not properly flesh, since it used to be the Word. So out of both things there is neither: there is some third thing that is entirely different from both. We find that Jesus is not just a dependent part of God, but is set forth as both God and Man. The psalm suggests this when it says that because God was born as a man, he built her by the will of the Father. We find that Jesus is both Son of God and Son of Man, because he is both God and Man. This is not confusing, but Jesus is one person who is both God and Man. I will talk about "Christ" later. To such a degree did each substance retain its own being, that in him the Spirit carried out its own acts--that is, powers and works and signs--while the flesh accomplished its own passions. Hungering with the devil, thirsting with the Samaritan woman, weeping for Lazarus, being troubled unto death--and at length it also died. But if there had been some third thing, a confusion of both, like electrum, there would not have been such distinct proofs of both substances; the Spirit would have performed the functions of the flesh and the flesh the functions of the Spirit, by interchange, or else neither those of the flesh nor those of the Spirit but those of some third form, by confusion: yes, either the Word would have died or the flesh would not have died, if the Word had been converted into flesh, for either the flesh would have been immortal or the Word mortal. Because both substances acted differently, each in its own quality, they both had their own activities and destinies. Therefore, learn from Nicodemus that what is born in the flesh is flesh and what is born of the Spirit is spirit. Flesh does not become spirit, nor spirit flesh--they can both be in one person. Jesus was made up of both of these substances--flesh as a man and spirit as God. On that occasion, the angel, in respect to the part where he was spirit, pronounced him the Son of God. The apostle also called him the mediator of God and man, which confirms that he is of both substances. Lastly, if you interpret "Son of God" as meaning flesh, show me who the Son of Man is. Or is he supposed to be the Spirit? But you want the Spirit to be taken as the Father himself, since God is spirit--as though, just as the Word is God, God's Spirit might not also be God's Word.

28. So you're saying that Christ is the Father, you idiot, because you don't even understand the meaning of this word. "Christ" is a title, not a name. It means "anointed one." But "anointed" is not a name either. It's something that belongs to a name. If, because of some stupid argument, we also called Jesus "clothed," like we call him Christ because of the anointing sacrament, would you then say that Jesus is the Son of God but believe that "clothed" is the Father? Now, concerning "Christ." If the Father is Christ, then the Father is anointed. And by someone else, no less. Or if by himself, prove it. But that's not what the Acts of the Apostles says. In that passage, the church is crying out to God, saying, "For in this city have all assembled together, Herod and Pilate with the gentiles, against thy holy Son whom thou hast anointed." Thus they testified that Jesus is the Son of God and that the Son was anointed by the Father. Consequently, Jesus will be the same as Christ who was anointed by the Father, not the same as the Father who anointed the Son. So also Peter: Therefore let all the house of Israel know that God has made both Lord and Christ - that is, anointed - this Jesus whom you crucified. But John even brands as a liar him who has denied that Jesus is Christ. In contrast, he says that everyone who believes that Jesus is Christ is born of God. For this reason, he also exhorts us to believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, so that we may have fellowship with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ. Paul always talks about God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. When he writes to the Romans, he thanks God through our Lord Jesus Christ. When he writes to the Galatians, he represents himself as an apostle from Jesus Christ and God the Father. And you can find texts like this throughout all of his collected works, where he states that there are two of them: God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father. He also says that Jesus himself is Christ, and, under another name, the Son of God. This is because both names belong to the same one person. If only "Jesus" is written, then "Christ" is understood because Jesus was anointed. But if only "Christ" is written, then the same person is also Jesus because the anointed one is Jesus. One of these names is a proper name that was given by an angel, while the other is an attributive name that comes from the anointing. But this only happens as long as Christ is the Son and not the Father. Finally, how blind is the man who doesn't understand that if he attributes the name of Christ to the Father, he is implying the existence of another god. For example, if Christ the Father is God, and he says "I ascend to my Father and your Father and my God and your God," he is clearly revealing the existence of another father and god above himself. Also, if the Father is Christ, there is someone else who created the thunder and spirit and announced Christ to mankind. And if the kings of earth stand up against the Lord and his Christ, there will be another lord against whose Christ they are gathered. And if the Lord says to Christ "Thus saith the Lord to my Lord Christ," there will be another lord who is speaking to Christ the Father. And when the apostle Paul writes that God may give you the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge, he is not saying that there will be another god who is the bestower of spiritual gifts. Certainly, so as not to wander over the whole ground, he who raised up Christ and is also going to raise up our mortal bodies, will be, as it were, another raiser up than the Father who died and the Father who was raised up, if it is the case that Christ who died is the Father.

29. Let this blasphemy be silent. Let it be enough to say that Christ, the Son of God, died, and this only because it is so written. For the apostle, while stating that Christ died, adds "according to the scriptures," so as to soften the statement and avoid offending the hearer. And yet, since Christ is both divine and human, and the divine is immortal, it is clear in what respect he says he died: in his human nature, as flesh and man and Son of Man, not in his divine nature as spirit and Word and Son of God. By saying that Christ - that is, the anointed - died, he makes it clear that that which was anointed died: his human nature. "So", you say, "we also who, for the same reasons as you, say that the Son died, do not blaspheme against the Lord God; for we say that he died not in respect of his divine but of his human substance." Yet you do blaspheme, not only because you say the Father died but also because you say he was crucified. For by converting Christ into the Father you blaspheme against the Father with that curse upon one crucified which by the Law accrues to the Son, because it was Christ, not the Father, who was made a curse for us. Whereas we, when we say that Christ was crucified, curse him not, but relate the curse of the Law, because neither did the apostle blaspheme when he said this. But just as a thing said of anyone of whom it may appropriately be said is said without blasphemy, so what is not appropriate is blasphemy if it is said. Consequently neither did the Father suffer with the Son. They're ashamed of blasphemy, so they try to make it sound better by saying that the Father and Son are two people. But this is stupid, because it's just another way of saying that the Son suffers. And if the Father is impassible, then he can't feel compassion for the Son. So your fear is pointless. For example, if a river is polluted by some mud, even though the one substance comes down from the spring and there is no interruption at the spring, the river's illness will not attach to the spring. And though the water that suffers damage belongs to the spring, as long as it suffers not in the spring but in the river, it is not the spring that suffers, but the river which comes from the spring. In the same way, how could the Spirit of God suffer in the Son? On the ground that the Spirit was suffering not in the Father but in the Son, would it seem that the Father had not suffered? But it is enough that the Spirit of God suffered nothing on his own account: because if he did suffer anything in the Son there was a possibility of the Father suffering with the Son, in the flesh. This has been discussed before and no one will deny our conclusion: we cannot suffer on behalf of God unless we have the Spirit of God in us, who also speaks to us about the things we need to confess, even though he himself does not suffer. But he gives us the ability to suffer.

30. Otherwise, if you keep asking questions, I'll have to give you a harsher answer and put you in conflict with what the Lord himself said. He cried out during his passion, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" This means either the Son was suffering and forsaken by the Father, or else the Father was suffering. But the apostle Paul wrote that the Father did not spare his Son. This is also what Isaiah said: "And the Lord has delivered him for our iniquities." He gave up his life because he didn't spare himself. He gave up his life because he handed himself over. But the Father didn't give up the Son, because the Son put his own spirit into the Father's hands. He put it there in short, and straightway died: for while the spirit remains in the flesh the flesh cannot die at all. Thus, to be given up by the Father was to the Son death. The Son therefore both dies and is raised up again by the Father according to the scriptures. The Son ascended into the higher parts of heaven, as he did also descend into the inner parts of the earth. This is the one who sits at the right hand of the Father, not the Father at his own right hand. This is the one whom Stephen sees, when he is being stoned, still standing at the right hand of God, as thenceforth to sit, until the Father does put all his enemies under his feet. This is he who is also to come again above the clouds of heaven in like fashion as also he ascended. This is the one who has received the gift from the Father and has poured it out—the Holy Spirit, the third name of God and the third sequence of majesty. He is the preacher of one monarchy and also the interpreter of the economy for those who accept his new prophecy. He leads them into all the truth that is in the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, according to the Christian mystery.

31. This matter is of Jewish faith, so to believe in one God as to refuse to count in with him the Son, and after the Son the Spirit. For what difference will there be between us and them except that disagreement? What need is there of the Gospel, what is that confidence of the New Testament which establishes the Law and the Prophets until John, unless thereafter Father and Son and Spirit, believed in as three, constitute one God? It was God's will to make a new covenant for the very purpose that in a new way his unity might be believed in through the Son and the Spirit, so that God who had aforetime been preached through the Son and the Spirit without being understood might now be known in his own proper names and persons. So let's be careful about these antichrists who deny that Jesus Christ is the Son of God. They deny the Father by saying he is the Son, and they deny the Son by saying he is the Father. They say Jesus Christ is not really the Son of God, but this is not true. Whoever agrees that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, God agrees with them and they agree with God. We believe what God says about his Son. Whoever does not have the Son does not have eternal life.
