# from The Italian (1797), Ann Radcliffe The following is an excerpt from The Italian, a novel written by Ann Radcliffe in 1797.

Around 1764, some English travelers in Italy were touring the area around Naples when they came across the portico of Santa Maria del Pianto, a church belonging to a very old convent of the Black Penitents order.

The travelers were so impressed by the grandeur of this portico, even though it was in poor condition, that they wanted to see the building it belonged to. They went up the marble steps leading to it.
