    <h1>Against Praxeas</h1>
    <p>
      <b>1</b>. In divers ways has the devil shown hostility to the Truth. At
      times he has tried to shake it by pretending to defend it. He is the
      champion of the one Lord, the Almighty, the creator of the world, so that
      he may make a heresy out of the unity. He says that the Father himself
      came down into the virgin, himself was born of her, himself suffered, in
      short himself is Jesus Christ. The serpent has forgotten himself: for when
      he tempted Jesus Christ after the baptism of John it was as Son of God
      that he attacked him, being assured that God has a son at least from those
      very scriptures out of which he was then constructing the temptation :
      <i>
        If thou art the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread</i
      >
      : again,
      <i>
        If thou art the Son of God cast thyself down from hence, for it is
        written that he </i
      >- the Father, of course -
      <i
        >hath given his angels charge concerning thee, that in their hands they
        should bear thee up, lest in any place thou dash thy foot against a
        stone</i
      >. Or will he accuse the gospels of lying, and say, "Let Matthew and Luke
      see to it: I for my part approached God himself, I tempted the Almighty
      hand to hand: that was the reason for my approach, that was the reason for
      the temptation: otherwise, if it had been &lt;only&gt; God's son, perhaps
      I should not have demeaned myself &lt; to tempt&gt; him&quot;? Nay but he
      himself rather is a liar from, the beginning, and so is any man whom he
      has suborned with his own &lt;coin&gt;, like Praxeas. For this person was
      the first to import to Rome out of Asia this kind of wrong headedness-a
      man generally of restless character, and moreover puffed up with boasting
      of his confessorship on account of nothing more than a mere short
      discomfort of imprisonment: though even if he had given his body to be
      burned he would have profited nothing, since he had not the love of God
      whose spiritual gifts he also drove out by assault. For at that time the
      bishop of Rome was on the point of recognising the prophecies of Montanus
      and Prisca and Maximilla, and as a result of that recognition was offering
      peace to the churches of Asia and Phrygia; but this man, by false
      assertions concerning the prophets themselves and their churches, and by
      insistence on the decisions of the bishop's predecessors, forced him both
      to recall the letters of peace already issued and to desist from his
      project of receiving the spiritual gifts. Thus Praxeas at Rome managed two
      pieces of the devil's business: he drove out prophecy and introduced
      heresy: he put to flight the Paraclete and crucified the Father. Praxean
      tares were sown above the wheat and had germinated here also, while many
      were asleep in simplicity of doctrine. Thereafter they were brought to
      light, by whom God would, and seemed even to have been rooted up. In fact
      the teacher gave security for amendment by return to his former opinions,
      and his bond remains in the custody of the natural men, in whose presence
      the transaction was then carried out. After that, silence. I for my part
      was subsequently separated from the natural men by my acknowledgement and
      defence of the Paraclete. But those tares had at that time scattered their
      seed everywhere, and so for a time it lay hid, deceptively dissembling its
      life, and has now burst forth anew. But it shall also be plucked up anew,
      if the Lord will, in the time now at my disposal: if not, then in its due
      time all counterfeit grain will be gathered and,. along with other
      offences, be burned up in un- quenchable fire.
