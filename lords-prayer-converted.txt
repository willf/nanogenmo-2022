Our Father,
who is in heaven,
may your name be kept holy,
may your kingdom come,
may your will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.
Give us today the food we need.
And forgive us for our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
And don't let us be tempted,
but save us from evil.
For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever.
Amen.
