    <h1>From<i>The Italian</i> (1797), Ann Radcliffe</h1>
    <p>
      About the year 1764, some English travellers in Italy, during one of their
      excursions in the environs of Naples, happened to stop before the portico
      of the Santa Maria del Pianto, a church belonging to a very ancient
      convent of the order of the Black Penitents.

    <p>
      The magnificence of this portico, though impaired by time, excited so much
      admiration, that the travellers were curious to survey the structure to
      which it belonged, and with this intention they ascended the marble steps
      that led to it.
